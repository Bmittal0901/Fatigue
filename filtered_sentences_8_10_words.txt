Atom

An atom is an extremely small piece of matter.
Atoms are from 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers across.
This makes one atom impossible to see without special tools.
Scientists learn how they work by doing experiments.
Atoms are made of three kinds of subatomic particles.
The electromagnetic force holds the nucleus and electrons together.
The forming or breaking of bonds is a chemical reaction.
Any substance which could be broken down was a "compound".
Also, they cannot combine with other atoms to form compounds.
The best model so far comes from the Schrödinger equation.
This was the world's first recorded nuclear fission reaction.
The nucleus is in the middle of the atom.
Otherwise, the outer shell needs eight electrons to be complete.
Shells that are farther from the nucleus have more energy.
We cannot know the exact place of an electron.
These have different shapes, or point in different directions.
Each orbital can be described by its three "quantum numbers".
The "principal quantum number" is the electron shell number.
For example, a chlorine atom has 17 electrons.
Atoms of the same element have the same atomic number.
These elements are organized on the periodic table.
Hydrogen-1 has a mass of about 1 amu.
When atoms are far apart, they attract each other.
The movement of electrons explains all chemical bonds.
All atoms attract each other by Van der Waals forces.
This movement gives a negative charge to that side.
This tells us how atoms act in a magnetic field.
Every electron has one of two opposite spins.
They are only weakly repelled by a magnetic field.
They are weakly attracted to a magnetic field.
An atom that does this is called "radioactive".
Every radioactive element or isotope has a "half-life".
This could happen inside stars or in supernovae.

Some of that growth was due to artificial breeding.
Others call it evolution when new species appear.
This is natural selection sped up by artificial conditions.
However, not every population is resistant to every chemical.

Organisms in any population vary in reproductive success.
Rare changes occur, and these changes can be inherited.
Other events, like natural selection and drift, reduce variation.
Those who survive will reproduce and create the next generation.
Adaptation is one of the basic phenomena of biology.
Not all features of an organism are adaptations.
Adaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species.

Hormone

Hormones are the chemical messengers of the endocrine system.
Hormones only act on cells which have the right receptors.
The first discovery of a hormone was made in 1902.
The word 'hormone' was first used in 1905.
There are four types of hormones in most vertebrates.
Hormone regulation is mostly done by negative feedback.
Glucose uptake by cells decreases blood glucose levels.
Steroid hormones are non-polar and do not need a receptor.
However a few things are controlled in different ways.
This hormone is made by the pituitary gland.
Nerves in the cervix send a message to the pituitary.
This message makes the pituitary release more oxytocin.

Heart

The heart is an organ found in every vertebrate.
The human heart has four chambers or closed spaces.
Some animals have only two or three chambers.
There is a right atrium and right ventricle.
These get blood that comes to the heart.
Blood going to the heart is carried in veins.
Blood going away from the heart is carried in arteries.
These bring blood from the body to the right heart.
These bring blood from the lungs to the left heart.
This is a tough sack that surrounds the heart.
A "heart beat" is when the heart muscle "contracts".
But the atria do systole "before" the ventricles.
When they get smaller we also say they "contract".
Electricity going through the heart makes the cells contract.
Once electrical impulse goes through the "atrio-ventricular node" (AV Node).
The AV Node makes the impulse slow down.
This brings the electrical impulse to the ventricles.
Bundle means strings or wires grouped together in parallel.
The electrodes see the electricity going through the heart.

People catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood.
This amounts to one malaria death every minute.
The parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called 'Plasmodium'.

Then they change into a different form of "Plasmodium".
This happens every few days, and is called a paroxysm.
"P. falciparum" is the most dangerous type of malaria.
Also, with "falciparum" malaria, the red blood cells are sticky.
This makes the red blood cells block blood vessels.
Pregnant women and children are hurt most by malaria.
Even if children do not die, many have brain damage.
The fever from malaria usually comes very suddenly.
Pregnant women and young children have more complications.
This test is called a "Giemsa blood smear".

Then they look at the slide under a microscope.
The "Plasmodium" is seen in the red blood cells.
People with different kinds of malaria need different medicines.
"Plasmodium" in some places is resistant to some medicines.
Everywhere except New Guinea, the treatment is the same.
Everywhere else, non-"falciparum" malaria is treated with chloroquine.
This is to kill the "Plasmodium" in the liver.
"Falciparum" malaria also has more resistance to medicines.
"Falciparum" malaria is always treated with two or more medicines.
For malaria, the vector is the "Anopheles" mosquito.
The most used method of vector control is pesticides.
The first pesticide used for vector control was DDT.
